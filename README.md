# Time Dilation
 
a Python script using the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity, we'll assume the scenario where you know the time experienced by an observer moving at a high velocity (relative to Earth) and want to find out how much time has passed on Earth. 
 
The script will prompt you to input the time experienced by the moving observer and the relative velocity, and it will calculate the corresponding time on Earth.
